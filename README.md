# text-mining

Please read the [instructions](instructions.md).

Overview:
I used the gutenberg website and download Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as my data source and started my analysis from there. The book is one of my favorite books in highschool and my childhood actually so I am also curious to do more analysis on it. Since it is just one plain text so I did not do any text comparison. I used Chracterizing by word frequncy and computing summary statistics
as my analysis technique. 

Implementation:
I used the url provided on hutenberg website as my data source to start off. I striped out the text out of headers to avoid mis calculation. Thus i was able to return a histogram of words and frequencies. I managed to have the code return the total words and different words in the text. Then, i used dictionaries to return paired words and its frequencies and started from there I was able to return the top most common words, words in the boom but not in word list and random words from the book.

Results:
The analysis shows that the book has a total 111231 number of words appear. 
Amongest the words, there are 8818 different words. 
The most common words(top ten) are:
and      6216
the      4843
i        3100
a        2927
to       2903
it       2183
was      2057
he       1660
of       1650
in       1434
Then here is the top 20 most frequently appeared words. 
says     638
got      622
said     476
see      471
come     378
one      367
get      332
jim      307
time     302
went     295

From here, we have a pretty good understanding of the book by just lookking at these 10 words. Says and said means this novel is mainly consist of conversations. Got, see, come, went all these are verbs and are very adventurous verbs. These words are highly related to the topic of text: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

Reflection:
The structure of the analysis was pretty much provided so it was easier for me to start this time. However, I still encountered some issue trying to fit my codes into the data. There are packages and settings that had problems but I managed to solve those by google or asking friends. I am actually curious to compare the two books, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer and see its similarity but due to time issue, I will have to work on it after submitting this work first. It is very hard to implement what I have learned into actual projects so I will have to keep working on trying hard to better help with my coding.
